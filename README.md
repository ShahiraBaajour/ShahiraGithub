# MVAR_GRANGER_CAUSALITY_FMRI
A Multivariate Autoregressive Analysis of human brain fMRI data consistent with principles of granger causality to assess the strength of directional interactions between regions performed in MATLAB. 
Note:
This tool is applicable for task-based fMRI timeseries; wherein onset times & number of conditions should be manually inputted to accomodate for the relative temporal precedence condition assumed in this analysis.
